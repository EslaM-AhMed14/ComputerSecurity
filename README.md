# Cipher Algorithms Implementation in Python

---

## Overview

This repository contains Python implementations of various classical cipher algorithms. These algorithms are fundamental in cryptography and have been historically used for securing sensitive information. Each implementation is provided in a Jupyter Notebook format for clarity and ease of understanding. Additionally, comprehensive documentation is included within each notebook, offering step-by-step explanations and visual examples to aid understanding.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. **Caesar Cipher** - A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

2. **Hill Cipher** - A polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra, utilizing matrix multiplication for encryption and decryption.

3. **Monoalphabetic Cipher** - A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is mapped to a single other letter in the ciphertext.

4. **Playfair Cipher** - A digraph substitution cipher where each plaintext digraph is substituted with another digraph according to a key.

5. **Rail Fence Cipher** - A transposition cipher where each letter of the plaintext is placed into different "rails" and then read off in a different order.

6. **Vigen√®re Cipher** - A polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword to shift letters in the plaintext, with different shift amounts determined by the positions of letters in the keyword.


## Documentation

- **Step-by-step Explanations**: Detailed explanations are provided within each notebook, guiding users through the encryption and decryption processes.
  
- **Visual Examples**: Visualizations are included to aid understanding of how each algorithm operates on input data.
